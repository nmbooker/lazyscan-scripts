=head1 NAME

lazyscan-scripts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of scripts that help my workflow when scanning documents for
archival.

I call it lazy because I aim to do as little up-front work organising
the documents as possible without regretting it later.

To this end, I try to get 2-sided scans right at scan time, but other than that
they won't be much more organised than when they were a stack 
of semi-organised to completely disorganised sheets of paper.

I scan each page to a separate .pnm file in an 'inbox' directory,
so I can organise the pages by document or topic at a later date.

Written mostly in Perl so far.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Debian commands for dependencies:

    # apt-get install libgetopt-long-perl perl-doc libnumber-range-perl
    # apt-get install parallel imagemagick

There may be some more I forgot to list - if they trip you up
please submit a pull request to add them.

=head1 NOTES TO SELF

I might find these useful for doing drag-and-drop document organisation tools:
